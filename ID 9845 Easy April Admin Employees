--assuming joining_date is a proper date type.
-- Null joining_date or department will automatically be ignored.

select 
count(worker_id) as n_admins -- no need of distinct because the tables primary key is worker id
from worker
where department = 'Admin'
-- assuming case sensitive else add lower(department) LIKE 'admin'
--LOWER(department) LIKE '%admin%'
--if question did not have any year then WHERE joining_date >= DATE '2026-04-01' is better due to performance considerations. EXTRACT(MONTH FROM joining_date) prevents using an index on joining_date.
and extract(month from joining_date) >= 4 -- its a number dont add ''
