https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10087-find-all-posts-which-were-reacted-to-with-a-heart?code_type=1

-- assuming reaction column has exact value 'heart' not free-text.
--distinct post as output even if same post has multiple likes
--Since we only care about posts that have a heart reaction -  inner join

SELECT DISTINCT p.*
FROM facebook_posts p
JOIN facebook_reactions r
  ON p.post_id = r.post_id
WHERE r.reaction = 'heart';
